Many thanks to Net Ninja for the excellent tutorial.

## Improvements

Several improvements have been added:

* Initial page with blinking text (animated)
* High scores using storage and custom classes (undocumented: press **C** to clear scores). Scores are stored locally.
* Two meteorite types inheriting from the same super class
* The starship tilts when it moves left or right
* The starship shakes when is hit by a meteorite
* Automatic removal of meteorites and lasers once they leave the viewport

## Assets

The included assets are:

* Sprites created by me
* *The Perfect Dark* font by Brian Kent
* Initial page image generated by an online AI image generator (unfortunately, I forgot which one)
* Star background taken from NASA

## Disclaimer

The game does not connect to the internet except to download its own data. It does not send anything to anyone (I cannot vouch for the Godot engine itself, but I believe it should *definitely* be safe).
